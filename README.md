## Update Log

### 22/05/24
- Fixed problem where Contributions section is too close to the section above it on certain desktop screen sizes.
- Added 'Back to Top' button which will be especially helpful for mobile users as they have to scroll further.


## Future Improvements
- Make all text smaller on mobile
- Add more images & profile picture
- Change navbar font colours, should be whiter and go more gray when hovered, not the opposite
- Make nav bar transparent?
- Make a card for each project, include a 'visit' button to go to the project and write more description about each
- Change id of back to top button href to 'home' for example instead of page top
- Add a contact form or remove contact from navbar in the mean time, OR make it more clear that the contact section is the details in the footer


## Local Hosting

- Open a preview or browser with this command: ```python3 -m http.server```
- Stop with CTRL + c in terminal.
