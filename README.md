### This is my person portfolio website, built by me for me! Click the link below to view. Thanks for visiting!

## Link to Live Site:

### [https://madeleinewalder.github.io/portfolio/](https://madeleinewalder.github.io/portfolio/)

## Future Improvements:
- Add image / profile picture
- Change navbar font colours, should be whiter and go more gray when hovered, not the opposite
- Make a card for each project, include a 'visit' button to go to the project and write more description about each

## Local Hosting

- Open a preview or browser with this command: ```python3 -m http.server```
- Stop with CTRL + c in terminal.
