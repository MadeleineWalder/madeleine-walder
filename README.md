## Future Improvements:
- Add image / profile picture
- Change navbar font colours, should be whiter and go more gray when hovered, not the opposite
- Make nav bar transparent?
- Make a card for each project, include a 'visit' button to go to the project and write more description about each
- Add a 'back to top' button

## Local Hosting

- Open a preview or browser with this command: ```python3 -m http.server```
- Stop with CTRL + c in terminal.
