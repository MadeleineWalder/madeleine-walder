WHAT TO DO NEXT:
Change font sizes, think about visual hierachy.
Skills lists text alignment is off.
Add images?
Kind of want image of Lewes not Brighton but its such a pain to get right...
Change navbar font colours, should be whiter and go more gray when hovered, not the opposite. Override bootstrap classes somehow.
Change the project links for buttons, then make the names bigger, write a little more underneath each, shorten/rewrite the projects info section
Add link to Arctic Sim Racing site???
Include links to 2Toucans?

HOSTING:
Consider how to host the website, think Heroku is closing down next year?
Maybe use Github hosting I think that is a thing and sounds simple + maybe free?
